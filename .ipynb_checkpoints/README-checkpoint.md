# Customer coupon acceptance rate

In this project we analyze data from respondents driving within some location to determine their relevant attributes and how likely they are to accept coupons.

## Coupons Categories
The coupons are categorized into:
1. Expensive restaurants
2. Bar
3. Carryout and Take away
4. Cheaper restaurants and Coffee houses


## Analysis Approach
The analysis for the coupon acceptance rate are based on attributes that might influence acceptance for a specific type of coupon. However some attributes are used across all categories. These are:
1. destination for the respondent
2. passanger type
3. weather
4. temperature
5. time and
6. age

## Findings

### Factors promoting acceptance of coupons
1. Friends passangers\
   Responds with friends tend to have higher acceptance rate.
3. Sunny weather
5. Higher temperatures\
   Higher temperature at 80 seem to have higher acceptance rate. Coffee coupons seem to be the only type that deviate from this general observation.
7. Day time(2pm, 10am and 6pm)\
   Most types of coupons tend to have relatively higher acceptance rate. On the contrary, coupons issues either too early(7am, or too late 10pm) tends to have lower acceptance rate. The are some deviants described in the latter section.
9. Cheaper restaurants and carryout coupon types\
    Cheaper restaurants and carryout tend to have the highest level of acceptance rate. This prominent across the relevant attributes.
11. Younger age(< 30)\
    From the charts there seem to be a correlation between acceptance and age, The younger the respondent the higher their chances of acceoting coupons. This is especially so for ages 20, 25, and 30.
13. Unmarried, single or partnered marital status 
15. Lack of college degree
16. Having no urgent destination

### Coupon type specific findings
#### Cheap Restaurants
1. Responds without urgent destination prominently display higher rates of acceptance. The rest two destinations are almost similar.
2. 2PM, 6PM and 10AM experience very high acceptance rate. We can hypothesize that this is because these times correspond to lunch or dinner times.

#### Expensive restaurants
1. Work destination has higher acceptance rate.
2. The same applies to the time slots 7am, 10pm and 10am which is an anomaly considering the other groups. We can hypothesize that this is because such restaurants possibly need reservations.
